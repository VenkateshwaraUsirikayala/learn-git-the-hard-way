Part 2 dealt with advanced local repository management and techniques

Part 3 is where it gets interesting! In this part you will start to interact

Now that you understand what a git repository is, how branches work, and how
they are all fundamentally equivalent, you are in a great position to understand
how to work with others using git.

In Part 3 you will cover:

- git push
- git fetch
- git pull
- git submodule
- pull requests
