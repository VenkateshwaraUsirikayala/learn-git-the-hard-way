=== Summary

In this section you've taken a step outside your local repository and started 
interacting with other repositories. This is where git really gets interesting,
as changes can be made and moved between different locations.

You've also learned about submodules, which allow git repositories to be nested
inside one another.

Finally, you've got to grips with what a pull request is, a central concept
within git usage.

You're already way beyond most git users' understanding of what's going on, and
going to build up to an even deeper understanding in the next chapter, where
you grapple with more advanced topics.
