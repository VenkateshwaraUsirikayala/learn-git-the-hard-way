Part 3 took you to the point where you could understand everything needed to
perform and manage pull requests.

Part 4 deals with more advanced topics that are not necessary for a good TODO



In part 4 you will cover:

- git log (advanced usage)

- bare repos
- working through history
- re-initialising a repo
- rebase/squashing
- internals?
