=== Summary


//CHAPTER 1 SUMMARY EXAMPLE
//In this section you have covered some of the basics of git. You learned about:
//
//- the 'four stages' of the git content lifecycle
//
//- ways git differs from other source control tools.
//
//- how git repositories are born, and that ALL GIT REPOSITORIES ARE BORN EQUAL!
//
//- various basic git commands, including add, commit, clone, branch, and checkout
//
//- the .git folder and some of its contents
//
//- what 'HEAD's and 'detached' heads are
//
//- what merge and merge conflicts are
//
//This is a lot of ground in a relatively short space of time, so make sure you
//have a grasp of all the above concepts. Don't worry if you're not expert or
//fully comforatble with them yet, but remember that if you stumble later it might
//be worth returning to some of these ideas.
//
//In the next section you will cover some more advanced aspects of managing git
//repos locally before you tackle remote git repository management.
